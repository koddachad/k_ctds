THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE NOTICES
============================

k-ctds wheel packages may bundle compiled copies of the following
third-party libraries. These libraries are not part of k-ctds itself
and are distributed under their own license terms.

All bundled libraries are DYNAMICALLY LINKED as shared objects
(.so on Linux, .dylib on macOS, .dll on Windows). They are copied
into the wheel by auditwheel (Linux) or delocate (macOS) and can
be located alongside the _tds extension module inside the installed
package. This means users can replace any bundled library with a
compatible version of their choosing, as described below.


FreeTDS
-------
License: GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.0
Website: https://www.freetds.org/
Source:  https://github.com/FreeTDS/freetds

k-ctds dynamically links against FreeTDS (libsybdb) for SQL Server
connectivity. When distributed as a pre-built wheel, the FreeTDS
shared library is bundled inside the wheel.

Because FreeTDS is dynamically linked (not statically linked), the
LGPL's requirements are satisfied: users retain the ability to replace
the bundled FreeTDS shared library with a different or modified version.

To use your own FreeTDS instead of the bundled copy, install k-ctds
from source:

    pip install k-ctds --no-binary k-ctds

Set the following environment variables to point to your FreeTDS
installation:

    CTDS_INCLUDE_DIRS=/path/to/freetds/include
    CTDS_LIBRARY_DIRS=/path/to/freetds/lib
    CTDS_RUNTIME_LIBRARY_DIRS=/path/to/freetds/lib

See LICENSE.FreeTDS for the full license notice.


OpenSSL
-------
License: Apache License 2.0 (OpenSSL 3.0+)
Website: https://www.openssl.org/
Source:  https://github.com/openssl/openssl

FreeTDS is compiled with TLS support via OpenSSL. Pre-built wheels
may include the OpenSSL shared libraries (libssl, libcrypto) as
transitive dependencies of FreeTDS — they are bundled automatically
by auditwheel or delocate.

OpenSSL 3.0 and later is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
See LICENSE.OpenSSL for the full license text.
